Okay, here is the enhanced version of the text. The improvements focus on clarity, better error explanation, structure, and readability, while retaining all the original information and sequence of events.

**Key Enhancements:**

1.  **Clearer Error Message:** The initial balance error is explicitly stated with the reason (Account Type Mismatch) and the specific API message.
2.  **Structured Output:** Added blank lines to separate distinct phases (Initialization, User Input, Trading Cycles).
3.  **Improved Logging Messages:** Made some messages slightly more descriptive (e.g., specifying the interval unit).
4.  **User Input Separation:** Clearly distinguished user input prompts from the subsequent log confirmation messages.
5.  **Consistent Formatting:** Maintained the timestamp, level, and module format.
6.  **Highlighting Recurring Issue:** The repeated warning about insufficient klines is preserved, clearly showing the bot is stuck in this state.
7.  **Completed Final Line:** The last log line is presented fully.
