Okay, this is already wonderfully thematic! The goal is to enhance it further, ensuring clarity, consistency, and even more evocative language where appropriate, while preserving the core technical information.

Here's an enhanced version:

**The Scroll of Pyrmethus Transformed: Announcing v2.8.0 (Strategic Illumination)**

The scroll of Pyrmethus v2.6.1, already a sophisticated tapestry of arcane energies—intricately woven with Phoenix Feather Resilience, dynamic ATR Wards, and foundational pyramiding enchantments—has undergone a profound transmutation. This alchemical evolution elevates the artifact to **v2.8.0 (Strategic Illumination)**, re-threading its very core with the `DualSupertrendMomentumStrategy` for more discerning market engagement, and bathing its entire console manifestation in a richer, more thematic Neon luminescence, thereby enhancing operational clarity and immersive focus.

Behold the key transmutations:

1.  **Core Strategy Reforged: The `DualSupertrendMomentumStrategy`**
    The primary offensive cantrip has been meticulously reforged into the `DualSupertrendMomentumStrategy`. This advanced paradigm synergizes dual SuperTrend indicators with a potent momentum filter, granting heightened precision in identifying and capitalizing on trade opportunities.
    *   **Invocation Conditions (Entries):**
        *   **Long Entreaty:** Conjured when the Primary SuperTrend signals a bullish reversal, the Confirmation SuperTrend corroborates an established uptrend, AND the underlying Momentum surges above a user-defined positive threshold, heralding auspicious market currents.
        *   **Short Curse:** Cast when the Primary SuperTrend indicates a bearish shift, the Confirmation SuperTrend aligns with a prevailing downtrend, AND Momentum dips below a configurable negative threshold, anticipating a descent.
    *   **Unwinding Conditions (Exits):** Positions are primarily unwound upon the augury of the *primary* SuperTrend reversing its current indication (e.g., a long position is closed if the primary SuperTrend divines a short signal).
    *   **Configuration Runes Enhanced:** The Alchemist's `Config` scroll now accepts new runes—`momentum_period` and `momentum_threshold`—granting finer dominion over the strategy's momentum-based discernment and responsiveness.
    *   **New Divination (`calculate_momentum`):** An incantation for `calculate_momentum`, drawing its potency from the `pandas_ta` library, has been newly scribed. This divination is seamlessly integrated into the `calculate_all_indicators` grand ritual, enriching the artifact's foresight.
    *   **SuperTrend Recalibration:** The `calculate_supertrend` divination has been meticulously refined for more steadfast communion with `pandas_ta`'s oracular outputs. This involves standardizing the spectral signature (i.e., float representation) of the multiplier parameter and its expected column names, ensuring robust indicator alignment and unwavering accuracy.

2.  **Aura of Neon Luminescence: The Enhanced Interface**
    As per your divine vision, the `NEON` prismatic lexicon has been significantly expanded. Its vibrant hues are now meticulously woven throughout the script's console manifestation, bathing every operational whisper and critical alert in a thematic glow, forging an unparalleled, immersive command experience.
    *   **Systematic Infusion of Light:** This comprehensive chromatic infusion ensures distinct visual cues for:
        *   **Log Levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `SUCCESS`):** Instantly convey the severity and nature of messages through distinct, thematic colors, from the gentle azure of `INFO` to the stark crimson of `CRITICAL`.
        *   **Strategic Insights (`STRATEGY`):** Clearly delineate pronouncements originating from the core trading intelligence with a dedicated hue.
        *   **Configuration Runes (`PARAM`, `VALUE`):** Emphasize the foundational settings and their chosen potencies, making them stand out amidst the data flow.
        *   **Financial Glyphs (`PRICE`, `QTY`, `PNL_POS/NEG/ZERO`):** Render crucial financial figures—prices, quantities, and profit/loss (positive, negative, or neutral)—with striking clarity, making them instantly discernible.
        *   **Market Stance (`SIDE_LONG/SHORT/FLAT`):** Provide an unambiguous visual sigil for the current position status, be it bullish, bearish, or neutral.
        *   **Output Structuring (`HEADING`, `SUBHEADING`):** Artfully delineate sections within the Oracle's pronouncements for improved readability and comprehension.
        *   **Decisive Actions (`ACTION`):** Draw immediate, unwavering attention to pivotal market interventions such as "Placing Order" or "Closing Position."
    *   **Refined Log Formatting:** The `_format_for_log` arcane helper has been re-attuned to wield this expanded palette with greater finesse. It now conjures more evocative descriptions for market currents, such as the verdant "Upward Flow" or the crimson "Downward Tide," replacing mere boolean truths with richer, actionable context.
    *   **Judicious Brightness:** The `Style.BRIGHT` incantation is now woven with precision, lending extra emphasis to pivotal data points and critical alerts, ensuring they capture the operator's gaze amidst the ever-flowing stream of information.

3.  **Sigil and Scroll Advancement:**
    The artifact's own version sigil has been advanced to `v2.8.0`. Consequently, its Phoenix Feather memories—the persistent state—will now be inscribed upon a new scroll, `pyrmethus_phoenix_state_v280.json`. This safeguards the enhanced iteration's unique journey, experiences, and accumulated wisdom.

4.  **Harmonious Integration with Established Arcana:**
    These powerful transmutations are not mere superficial additions but are deeply and harmoniously interwoven with the sophisticated arsenal of enchantments inherited from v2.6.1. The revered Phoenix Feather Resilience (ensuring unwavering state persistence), the adaptive dynamic ATR Wards (providing intelligent stop-loss mechanisms), the foundational pyramiding enchantments (allowing strategic position scaling), and the precise partial close rituals now all heed the refined commands of the `DualSupertrendMomentumStrategy`. These vital systems operate with enhanced synergy, guided by the new strategic core and fully illuminated by the Neon Luminescence, offering unparalleled visual feedback, profound insight, and ultimately, greater mastery over the market's ebb and flow.

Key changes and why:

*   **Title:** Added a more engaging title.
*   **Opening:** "profound transmutation," "alchemical evolution" – slightly stronger thematic words. "thereby enhancing operational clarity and immersive focus" – more direct benefit statement.
*   **Section Titles:** Made them a bit more descriptive within the theme (e.g., "The `DualSupertrendMomentumStrategy`" added to the title).
*   **Invocation Conditions:** Added small thematic flourishes like "heralding auspicious market currents" and "anticipating a descent."
*   **`calculate_momentum`:** "enriching the artifact's foresight."
*   **SuperTrend Recalibration:** Clarified "spectral signature (i.e., float representation)" and added "unwavering accuracy."
*   **Neon Luminescence:** "forging an unparalleled, immersive command experience."
*   **Systematic Infusion of Light:** Rephrased the intro to the list for better flow and added examples for log levels.
*   **Sigil and Scroll Advancement:** Added "unique journey, experiences, and accumulated wisdom" for more flavor.
*   **Harmonious Integration:** This section was already good but was essentially the previous final paragraph. I've made it point 4 as in the original, and then expanded on the *benefits* of this integration in the final sentence, effectively combining the old point 4 and the old concluding paragraph into a stronger, more conclusive statement. I also explicitly listed the benefits of the preserved features (e.g., "ensuring unwavering state persistence").
*   **Flow and Word Choice:** General minor tweaks throughout for rhythm, stronger verbs, and more consistent thematic language (e.g., "chromatic infusion," "pronouncements").
*   **Removed Redundancy:** The final paragraph of the original text was largely a restatement of its point 4. I've integrated these concepts more cohesively into the new point 4 to provide a stronger conclusion.

This version aims to retain all technical accuracy while amplifying the engaging, arcane narrative.
