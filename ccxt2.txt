You've sent the same set of 20 CCXT Bybit shell functions again.  It looks like you might be re-pasting or checking if they are still available.

These functions are still valid and ready to be used as described in the previous response.

Is there anything specific you'd like to do with these functions now?  For example, are you looking to:

*   **Modify** any of these functions?
*   **Add** more functions?
*   **Troubleshoot** any errors you are encountering when using them?
*   **Understand** how a particular function works?

Let me know how I can help you further!
