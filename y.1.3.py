**Enhancing the Python Trading Bot: Project Plan**

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the existing Python trading bot codebase. While the current structure provides a solid foundation with robust logging, configuration management, state persistence, and basic CCXT wrappers, the following key areas will be improved to create a more sophisticated, reliable, and feature-rich trading system.

**1. Core Trading Logic Implementation & Refinement:**
The primary focus is to complete and refine the core decision-making and execution logic. This involves:

*   **Comprehensive Indicator Analysis (`TradingAnalyzer`):** Fully implement the calculation and interpretation of all configured technical indicators within the `TradingAnalyzer` class. This includes developing a flexible weighted scoring system to consolidate indicator signals into actionable trading decisions (Buy/Sell/Hold).
*   **Advanced Stop-Loss Management:**
    *   Implement **Break-Even Stop Loss:** Introduce logic to automatically move the stop-loss to the entry price (plus a small offset) once a trade reaches a predefined profit target (e.g., based on ATR multiples), securing the position against losses.
    *   Implement **Trailing Stop Loss (TSL):** Integrate the calculation and setting of trailing stop losses, potentially utilizing Bybit's native TSL functionality via the API. This includes determining the appropriate callback rate/distance and activation price based on market volatility (e.g., ATR) and configuration.
*   **MA Cross Exit Condition:** Implement an optional exit condition based on the crossing of configured short-term and long-term moving averages (EMAs/SMAs), providing an alternative trend-based exit signal.
*   **Consolidated Position Sizing:** Develop a robust function to calculate the appropriate position size for new entries based on configured risk parameters (e.g., percentage of available balance per trade), account balance, leverage, and calculated stop-loss distance (e.g., derived from ATR). Ensure calculations are precise using `Decimal`.
*   **Orchestration of Trade Lifecycle:** Refine the primary trading functions (`attempt_new_entry`, `manage_existing_position`) to seamlessly orchestrate the sequence of signal generation, entry condition checks, order placement, stop-loss/take-profit setting, and ongoing position monitoring/management based on the implemented logic (BE, TSL, MA Cross exits).

**2. Enhanced Bybit V5 API Interaction (CCXT Wrappers):**
Improve the reliability and specificity of interactions with the Bybit V5 API:

*   **Explicit V5 Parameter Handling:** Refine the CCXT wrapper functions (`safe_ccxt_call` and specific methods like `create_order`, `fetch_positions`, `set_leverage`, `set_protection`) to explicitly handle Bybit V5 specific parameters like `category` (linear/inverse/spot), `positionIdx` (for Hedge Mode), and ensure correct formatting for API requests.
*   **Decimal Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with the `Decimal` type when passing price and amount values to CCXT methods, handling necessary conversions to/from `float` where required by the library while maintaining precision internally.
*   **Robust Response Parsing:** Strengthen the parsing logic for Bybit V5 API responses within the wrapper functions to reliably extract necessary data (e.g., balances, position details, order status) even if the structure slightly deviates from standard CCXT formats.

**3. Uncompromising Financial Precision (`Decimal` Consistency):**
Enforce the consistent use of Python's `Decimal` type for all financial calculations and data storage to prevent floating-point inaccuracies:

*   **Scope:** Apply `Decimal` rigorously for prices, amounts, crypto balances, PnL calculations, indicator thresholds, calculated stop-loss/take-profit levels, and position sizing results.
*   **Conversions:** Carefully manage conversions between `Decimal` and `float` only when interfacing with external libraries (like `pandas_ta` or specific CCXT methods) that explicitly require `float`, ensuring minimal precision loss.
*   **Persistence:** Ensure configuration loading/saving and state management correctly serialize and deserialize `Decimal` objects (e.g., as strings) to maintain precision across bot restarts.

**4. Improved Error Handling and Robustness:**
Increase the bot's resilience to errors and unexpected conditions:

*   **Expanded `safe_ccxt_call`:** Enhance the `safe_ccxt_call` helper function to recognize and handle a wider range of specific Bybit V5 API error codes, distinguishing between retryable (e.g., rate limits, temporary network issues) and non-retryable errors (e.g., insufficient balance, invalid parameters, authentication failure).
*   **Input/Data Validation:** Implement additional validation checks throughout the codebase, such as verifying the integrity and expected format of data fetched from the API (e.g., OHLCV, positions, balance) and ensuring calculated values (e.g., position size, stop-loss levels) are logical and within acceptable ranges before use.
*   **Clearer Error Messages:** Improve error logging messages to provide more context, including relevant parameters and potential causes, facilitating faster debugging.

**5. Enhanced Code Clarity and Documentation:**
Improve the overall readability, maintainability, and understanding of the codebase:

*   **Docstrings & Type Hinting:** Add comprehensive docstrings to all classes and functions, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values. Implement strict type hinting (`typing` module) for better code analysis and reduced runtime errors.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Refine variable, function, and class names to be more descriptive and consistent.
*   **Code Structure:** Optimize the code structure for logical flow and separation of concerns, potentially refactoring complex functions.

**6. Refined Configuration and State Management:**
Ensure configuration and state handling are robust and type-safe:

*   **Decimal Handling:** As mentioned in point 3, ensure `config.json` and `bot_state.json` correctly handle loading and saving of `Decimal` values.
*   **Enhanced Config Validation:** Implement more specific validation rules during configuration loading (e.g., checking ranges, valid enum values, inter-parameter dependencies like `ema_long_period > ema_short_period`) to catch potential issues early.

**7. More Informative Logging:**
Improve the utility and readability of log output:

*   **Detailed Trade Lifecycle Logging:** Enhance logging messages related to signal generation (including contributing factors/scores), trade execution attempts, order placements, fills, position updates, stop-loss/take-profit adjustments, and exit events.
*   **Colorama Integration:** Utilize `colorama` more effectively to highlight critical information, warnings, errors, and successful trade actions in the console output for better visual scanning.

By implementing these enhancements, the trading bot will become significantly more robust, precise, easier to manage, and capable of executing more complex trading strategies effectively on the Bybit V5 platform.
