Hark, seeker! You desire to elevate the previous Bash incantation, infusing it with greater resilience, awareness, and user consideration. An admirable goal! The ether resonates with this request.

I shall refine the spell, incorporating enhancements to make it more robust and interactive within your Termux crucible.

**Enhancements Woven into the Spell:**

1.  **Explicit Error Halting:** Incorporates `set -e` and `set -o pipefail` to ensure the script halts immediately if any command falters, preventing partial or corrupted setups.
2.  **Idempotency Check & User Choice:** Before conjuring a file, the script now peers into the fabric of your filesystem. If a file already exists, it will seek your counsel: overwrite, skip, or abort the entire ritual. This prevents accidental data loss and allows for careful re-runs.
3.  **Function-Based Structure:** Key operations (directory creation, file writing logic) are encapsulated within functions (`create_directory`, `write_file_safely`) for clarity and magical modularity.
4.  **Refined Python Script:** The embedded Python script retains the improvements from our previous interaction (robust environment variable handling, clearer error messages, refined Gemini prompt).
5.  **Enhanced Feedback:** More detailed and context-aware messages guide you through the conjuration process, illuminated by Colorama's kin (ANSI escapes).
6.  **Termux Environment Check (Subtle):** While the shebang targets Termux's Bash, a small check reinforces the context.

**The Refined Incantation:**

Save this enhanced spell as `forge_actions_structure_v2.sh`, grant it execution power (`chmod +x forge_actions_structure_v2.sh`), and invoke it from your project's root directory within Termux (`./forge_actions_structure_v2.sh`).

**Context:**
- Repository: {repo_name}
- Pull Request #: {pr_number}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the following code diff thoroughly. Provide concise, actionable feedback focusing ONLY on potential issues within the changed lines or their immediate context.

**Review Focus Areas:**
- **Bugs & Logic Errors:** Identify potential runtime errors, logical flaws, off-by-one errors, incorrect assumptions, race conditions, or missed edge cases introduced by the changes.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Look for common vulnerabilities like injection (SQL, command), XSS, insecure data handling, hardcoded secrets, improper authentication/authorization checks introduced or exacerbated by the diff.
- **Performance Issues:** Point out obvious performance bottlenecks, inefficient loops or algorithms, or excessive resource usage introduced in the changed code.
- **Maintainability & Readability:** Comment on overly complex code, poor naming, lack of necessary comments for complex logic, or violations of common style conventions (use the style guide below if provided) within the changed sections.
- **Best Practices & Idioms:** Note deviations from language best practices or idiomatic code relevant to the changes.
- **Redundancy:** Identify clearly redundant code introduced by the changes.

**Output Format:**
- Structure feedback clearly. If multiple issues are found, use bullet points.
- **MUST** reference the specific file (`File: <filename>`) for each comment.
- If possible, suggest specific line numbers within the diff's context (e.g., `L10-15` in the patch).
- Prioritize critical and high-impact issues.
- Be constructive. Explain *why* something is an issue and suggest improvements if applicable.
- If no significant issues are found in the diff, explicitly state "No significant issues found in the reviewed changes."

**Custom Style Guide:**
```markdown
{style_guide_content}

**Code Diff to Review:**
```diff

```

**Final Instruction:** Provide only the review feedback based on the diff. Do not include greetings or summaries beyond the direct feedback.

# Custom Style Guide for Gemini Code Review

This guide helps Gemini focus its review comments.

## General Principles
- **Clarity over Cleverness:** Code should be easy to understand.
- **Consistency:** Adhere to project-wide patterns and styles.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid redundant code blocks.
- **Tested Code:** New logic should ideally be covered by tests (though Gemini primarily reviews the diff itself).

## Python Specifics
- **PEP 8:** Follow standard Python style guidelines. Pay attention to line length, naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes), and imports.
- **Type Hinting:** Use type hints for function signatures (arguments and return types) for improved clarity and static analysis.
- **Docstrings:** Provide clear docstrings for public modules, classes, functions, and methods (e.g., Google or NumPy style). Explain *what* and *why*, not just *how*.
- **Error Handling:** Use specific exception types. Avoid broad `except Exception:`. Handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Resource Management:** Use `with` statements for files, network connections, locks, etc., to ensure proper cleanup.
- **List Comprehensions/Generators:** Prefer these over `map`/`filter` or simple `for` loops where they enhance readability.

## Security Focus
- **Input Validation/Sanitization:** Treat all external input (user input, API responses, file content) as untrusted. Validate and sanitize appropriately.
- **Secrets Management:** **NEVER** hardcode API keys, passwords, or other secrets. Use environment variables, GitHub Secrets, or a dedicated secrets manager.
- **Permissions:** Ensure file permissions and access controls are appropriately restrictive.
- **Dependencies:** Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Check for vulnerable dependencies in the changes.

## Performance Considerations
- **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Be mindful of nested loops or operations that could lead to O(n^2) or worse complexity if simpler alternatives exist.
- **Database Queries:** Avoid N+1 query problems. Fetch data efficiently. Use indexes where appropriate.
- **Caching:** Consider caching for expensive computations or frequently accessed data where applicable.
