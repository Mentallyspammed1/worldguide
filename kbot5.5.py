This Python script represents a sophisticated trading bot, characterized by its robust design and extensive feature set. The enhancements detailed below are aimed at further improving clarity, conciseness, and overall code flow. These improvements primarily involve meticulous refinement of existing code, more descriptive comments, consistent styling, and addressing subtle logical points. Given the script's substantial size and impressive existing quality—already incorporating several advanced snippets (such as those for environment handling and retry logic, often referred to as "Snippet X" in comments)—the changes are incremental, focusing on polish and fine-tuning rather than a fundamental rewrite.

Here's a summary of the types of enhancements applied:

1.  **Imports:**
    *   Reordered to standard library, then third-party.
    *   Alphabetized within groups.
    *   Removed `wrong-import-order` and `wrong-import-position` from pylint disables.

2.  **Comments and Docstrings:**
    *   Minor clarifications in comments.
    *   Ensured docstrings accurately reflect functionality.
    *   Added a few more comments in complex logical blocks for better understanding.

3.  **Code Style and Readability:**
    *   Minor adjustments for line length where feasible without breaking readability of complex lines (e.g., log messages, Rich Text compositions).
    *   Ensured consistent use of f-strings for formatted strings.
    *   Slightly improved formatting in some multi-line statements or dictionary definitions.

4.  **Logic Refinements (Minor):**
    *   In `ExchangeManager._load_market_info`, the `get_dp_from_precision` helper's check `isinstance(exponent, int)` for Decimal exponent was confirmed to be technically redundant but harmless.
    *   Validated the quantity calculation logic in `OrderManager._calculate_trade_parameters` for both linear and inverse contracts, which appears correct based on typical exchange mechanics where `total_equity` is in the settlement currency.
    *   Ensured `fetch_with_retries` correctly handles `exc_info` for logging.
    *   In `TradingBot.trading_spell_cycle`, confirmed the logic for updating `live_positions_state`, `final_positions_for_panel`, and `protection_tracker_snapshot` through various stages of the cycle (TSL, exits, entries) to ensure accurate state representation.

5.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Reviewed logging messages for clarity and consistency.
    *   Ensured critical error paths lead to appropriate logging and, where necessary, system exit.
    *   The `termux_notify` function usage is appropriate.

6.  **Pylint Disables:**
    *   The `pylint: disable` list remains largely the same as many are justified by the script's nature (e.g., `too-many-lines`, `too-many-instance-attributes` for `TradingConfig`) or thematic choices. The specific import-related disables were removed after correction.

The script is already a highly advanced trading engine, particularly notable for its integration of these specialized snippets. These pre-existing modules effectively address complex challenges such as robust environment variable management, resilient API retry mechanisms, secure data type conversions, precise Bybit V5 parameter formatting, and rigorous position state verification. Consequently, the current set of enhancements is intentionally focused on further polishing the codebase, aiming to maximize its maintainability and comprehensibility despite its inherent sophistication.
