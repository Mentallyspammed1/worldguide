**Key Fixes and Improvements:**

1.  **Heredoc Syntax:** The primary fix was applied to the `json_payload=$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)` block. The opening `{` of the JSON now starts on the line *after* `<<EOF`, and the closing `EOF` remains at the beginning of its line, as required by bash heredoc syntax.
2.  **File Identification:**
    *   The logic to get changed files (`git diff`) is now stored in a bash array `files_to_process` using `mapfile` for more robust handling, especially with filenames containing special characters.
    *   Added handling for the initial push to a branch (`github.event.before` is all zeros) to process all files in the commit instead of failing on the diff.
    *   Improved the loop to iterate over the `files_to_process` array.
    *   Added checks (`[[ ! -f "$file" ]]`, `[[ ! -s "$file" ]]`) inside the loop to ensure the file still exists and is not empty before processing.
3.  **JSON Escaping in Prompt:** Explicitly escaped the backticks (`) within the Gemini prompt text (`\\\`\\\`\\\``) to prevent them from being interpreted by the shell or causing issues within the JSON string.
4.  **API URL Model:** Updated the example `api_url` to use `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`, which is a more common and generally available model. **Remember to change this if you intend to use a different specific model.**
5.  **Safer File Writing:** Replaced `echo "${enhanced_content}" > "$file.gemini_tmp"` with `printf '%s' "$enhanced_content" > "$file.gemini_tmp"` which is generally safer for writing arbitrary content, especially if it might start with `-`.
6.  **Commit Logic:** Changed `git add .` to `git add .` which is functionally similar in this context but slightly more common. Ensured the check for changes uses `git diff --staged --quiet` as changes are staged before the check.
7.  **Error Handling & Logging:** Added more specific log messages and improved checks (e.g., curl exit status, empty file content check).
8.  **Rate Limiting:** Increased the `sleep` duration slightly to `2` seconds between API calls as a basic rate-limiting measure. Adjust as needed based on observed API behavior.
9.  **Clarity:** Added comments and improved script structure for better readability.
