Okay, here is the enhanced version of the text. The improvements focus on slightly more formal language, enhanced clarity, better flow, and ensuring consistent terminology, while preserving the original structure and technical details.

**Enhanced Text:**

This document outlines the plan for integrating **25 Bybit CCXT code snippets** into the **Pyrmethus Scalping Bot** (`ps.py`). The primary objective is to enhance the bot's functionality and robustness by strategically incorporating the most relevant snippets, while carefully preserving its existing architecture and core trading logic.

Given that integrating all 25 snippets would result in an excessively long and potentially redundant codebase (as many snippets replace or enhance similar functions), this plan adopts a targeted approach focused on key improvements.

**1. Integration Strategy:**

The integration will adhere to the following principles:

*   **Select Key Snippets:** Prioritize snippets that directly improve core bot operations, such as exchange initialization, order placement and management, position handling, reliable data fetching, and effective rate limit management.
*   **Replace or Enhance Existing Functions:** Integrate the selected snippets into the `ps.py` codebase, replacing or augmenting current functions. This will be done while meticulously preserving the bot's established trading logic (e.g., the `DUAL_EHLERS_VOLUMETRIC` strategy and its signal generation process).
*   **Add New Utility Functions:** Incorporate standalone helper functions derived from the snippets to introduce advanced capabilities, such as trailing stops or funding rate analysis.
*   **Ensure Compatibility:** Verify seamless integration with the bot's existing dependencies (`ccxt`, `pandas`, `talib`, `colorama`, `dotenv`) and its helper functions (e.g., `safe_decimal_conversion`, `format_order_id`, `send_sms_alert`).
*   **Maintain Core Structure:** Retain the bot's configuration system (`Config` class) and the existing logging and SMS alert mechanisms.

**2. Selected Snippets for Direct Integration:**

Based on the strategy, the following 15 snippets have been selected for direct integration, categorized by their primary function:

*   **Core Operations:**
    *   Snippet 1: Initialize Bybit Exchange with Retry (Replaces initial exchange setup).
    *   Snippet 2: Set Leverage with Validation (Enhances leverage configuration).
    *   Snippet 3: Fetch USDT Balance with Precision (Improves balance checking accuracy).
    *   Snippet 4: Place Market Order with Slippage Protection (Upgrades `place_risked_market_order`).
    *   Snippet 5: Cancel All Open Orders (Adds robust bulk order cancellation).
    *   Snippet 9: Close Position with Reduce-Only (Enhances position exit logic).
*   **Data Fetching:**
    *   Snippet 6: Fetch OHLCV with Pagination (Replaces existing OHLCV fetching for reliability).
    *   Snippet 13: Fetch Order Book with Depth (Improves data for `analyze_order_book`).
    *   Snippet 17: Fetch Ticker with Validation (Adds reliable real-time price data retrieval).
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   Snippet 11: Fetch Funding Rate (Adds funding rate awareness, potentially for signal filtering).
    *   Snippet 14: Place Conditional Stop Order (Enhances stop-loss placement mechanism).
    *   Snippet 18: Place Trailing Stop Order (Adds native trailing stop support).
    *   Snippet 23: Fetch Position Risk (Adds monitoring of liquidation price and other risk metrics).
*   **Error and Rate Limit Handling:**
    *   Snippet 10: Handle Rate Limit Exceeded (Provides a wrapper for robust API call execution).
    *   Snippet 25: Monitor API Rate Limit (Helps track API usage against exchange limits).

**3. Implementation Approach:**

The implementation will proceed as follows:

*   **Provide Modified Code:** Present a version of `ps.py` that integrates the 15 selected snippets, replacing or enhancing the relevant functions.
*   **Retain Core Logic:** Ensure the bot's fundamental trading strategy (`DUAL_EHLERS_VOLUMETRIC`), signal processing, and position sizing methodology remain intact.
*   **Include Helper Functions:** Add new utility functions derived from the snippets as standalone, reusable helpers within the script.
*   **Comment Integration Points:** Clearly indicate within the code comments where each snippet has been integrated or is being utilized.
*   **Artifact Wrapping:** Enclose the modified `ps.py` code within an `<xaiArtifact/>` tag, assigning a unique `artifact_id`.
*   **Summarize Remaining Snippets:** Briefly describe the potential use cases for the 10 snippets not directly integrated in this phase and suggest how they could be incorporated if needed in the future.

**4. Assumptions:**

The integration process is based on the following assumptions:

*   The original `ps.py` file (as provided in the context) serves as the baseline codebase, including its `Config` class, `logger` setup, and existing helper functions.
*   The bot targets Bybitâ€™s V5 API, specifically for USDT-margined perpetual futures operating under the unified margin account structure.
*   All required dependencies (`ccxt`, `pandas`, `talib`, `colorama`, `python-dotenv`) are installed, and the `.env` file is correctly configured with API credentials.
*   The bot's `Config` class contains necessary parameters like `RETRY_COUNT`, `RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`, `TAKER_FEE_RATE`, etc.
*   The primary focus of this integration phase is on enhancing robustness and immediate usability, with minimal alterations to the core strategy logic itself.
